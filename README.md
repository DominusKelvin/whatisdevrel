# What is DevRel?

A site that explains what DevRel is to the user and includes resources.

Essentially use the content from my devrel blog post and devrel repo.

## WTDS

- [ ] Get smooth scrolling to work with a ref
- [ ] Remove down arrow and replace with a nice button on the homepage
- [ ] Fix mobile responsiveness issue of homepage
- [ ] Make it only dark mode and dark by default
- [ ] Fix the picture that I have by asking a designer to redo it
- [ ] Finish v1 and share with Lee, Shawn (& sam / tejas?)

## V2

- [ ] Add newsletter
- [ ] When job board is done, link to it
- [ ] Maybe add a section for what DevRel is at Vercel authored by Lee
