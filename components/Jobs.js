        Getting a job in DevRel
      </h1>
      <p>To stand out, you should try to have 2 out of 3 of these.</p>
      <p>
        1. You can code. For this, you can show off some of your side projects.
        2. You can build communities. You can show off helping build a community
        or organization. 3. You're a good content creator. You can show off your
        talks, YouTube videos, tweets, and blog posts for this one. While there
        aren't pre-requisites for the job, it's very helpful to have prior work
        in these areas to show off and get your career in developer advocacy
        started. If you don't have prior work, you should start creating content
        (blogs, videos, side projects) that helps demonstrate you can already do
        the work. Ultimately, this is a role for engineers who enjoy working
        with developers, creating content, and managing communities.
