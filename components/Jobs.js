        This is a relatively new role so to stand out though, you should try to
        have 2 out of 3 of these. You can code. For this, you can show off some
        of your side projects. You can build communities. You can show off
        helping build a community or organization. You're a good content
        creator. You can show off your talks, YouTube videos, tweets, and blog
        posts for this one. While there aren't pre-requisites for the job, it's
        very helpful to have prior work in these areas to show off and get your
        career in developer advocacy started. If you don't have prior work, you
        should start creating content (blogs, videos, side projects) that helps
        demonstrate you can already do the work. Ultimately, this is a role for
        engineers who enjoy working with developers, creating content, and
        managing communities.
